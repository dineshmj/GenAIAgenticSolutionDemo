Greetings! I am Monitory Information Network Agent (MINA).

How may I assist you today?
You: Hi Mina! I'm Will Smith. I just moved to Brisbane today. I'm planning to live in Kelvin Groves in Brisbane.

Mina: Hello Will! It's great to hear from you. It sounds like you're looking to set up something related to your new home in Brisbane. 

Could you please let me know if you're interested in opening a Savings Bank Account or applying for a Home Loan?
You: I have found an Apartment in Kelvin Groves, and I really want to buy it.

Mina: Got it, Will! You're interested in applying for a Home Loan to purchase the apartment in Kelvin Groves.

Let's get started with your application. I'll need a few details from you:

1. What is the amount you are looking to borrow (loan amount)?
You: The Apartment costs 3.2 million AUD. I have 200 thousand AUD at the moment to shell out.

Mina: Thank you for that information, Will. To confirm, your requested loan amount will be 3.2 million AUD (total cost) minus your down payment of 200 thousand AUD. That means your loan amount will be 3 million AUD.

Next, could you please tell me the loan tenure in years that you are planning to apply for?
You: I need the loan for at least 12 years.

Mina: Thank you, Will! Here's what I have for your home loan application:

You: It is 1024.
